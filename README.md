# Truth or dare?

*Automated fact checking for everyone.*

**ðŸš§ Under development. At this time, there is nothing useful to see here. ðŸš§**

## Development setup

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

```console
$ docker-compose run worker python -m unittest
```

If you see a sequence of dots, it means everything is working (at least for development).

## Running for development

```console
$ cp .env.example .env
$ docker-compose up
```

## Running in production

The recommended way of running in a production environment is with [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com). Create an account and put your brand new "Project ID" in the `.env` file.

Open a new shell session (by opening a new terminal window, for instance) and run the following snippet to setup a new virtual machine. After the `eval`, `docker-compose` commands in this session will be executed in the remote server, not your local environment.

```console
$ export $(cat .env | xargs)
$ docker-machine create \
    --driver google \
    --google-project $GCLOUD_PROJECT \
    --google-zone $GCLOUD_ZONE \
    --google-scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read-write,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring.write"" \
    --engine-install-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623081500/https://get.docker.com \
    truth-or-dare-google
$ eval $(docker-machine env truth-or-dare-google)
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

And deployments are made running the following:

```console
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```
